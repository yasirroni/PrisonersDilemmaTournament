    Nice Patient Reflective Tit for Tat (NPRTT):
        1. Nice: Never initiate defection, else face the wrath of the Grudge.
        2. Patient: Respond to defection with defection, unless it was in possibly
            response to my defection. Give opponent a chance to cooperate again since,
            even if they backstab me a few more times, we'll both come out ahead.
            I don't have to worry about this causing my opponent to actually win
            because the Grudge and Tit for Tat will penalize them heavily for
            initiating defection.
        3. Reflective: Before cooperating in forgiveness, we check whether the opponent
            has defected so far more than 1/2 of the time. If they have, then we'd
            probably lose out by cooperating.
        4. Tit for Tat: (see Patient)

    This strategy generates interesting results. If you look at head-to-head matchups,
    for example, it "loses" to strategies like joss. However, compare that to Tit for
    Tat: Tit for Tat has a low-scoring "win" vs. joss. NPRTT, on the other hand, has
    a high-scoring "loss" vs. joss.

    A cycle of mutual defection is costly because C/C is worth 2 more points than D/D.
    So even if we suffer one D/C (0) for every 2 C/C's (+6), that's still 2 points on
    average for that group of 3, vs. 1 point on average for a series of D/D. This also
    guides the 1/2 cutoff for the Reflective trait.
